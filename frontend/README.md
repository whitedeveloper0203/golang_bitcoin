## ToDo

-persist winnings/losses in db

-use actual price


-after signup, let user know that a verification email has been sent and that they need to deal with it before they can login (it's just logged to the console at the moment)

-dont let user go "back" to the auth0 login page once logged in (we get an invalid token err and its just bad UX)

-markup and styles to display appropriate data (chart)

Run the app -
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Run the Application With Docker

In order to run with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in unix, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.
